## Description: <br>
Used for smoke or dataset finetuning of NV-Segment-CT VISTA3D on CT NIfTI labels. Not for clinical validation. <br>

This skill is for research and development only. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache-2.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and engineers finetuning the NV-Segment-CT VISTA3D segmentation model on their own CT datasets for engineering verification and research purposes. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Reference(s): <br>
- [Task06 and Results Reference](references/task06-and-results.md) <br>


## Skill Output: <br>
**Output Type(s):** [Shell commands, Configuration files, JSON] <br>
**Output Format:** [JSON (structured output.json with validation metrics and checkpoint paths)] <br>
**Output Parameters:** [1D] <br>
**Other Properties Related to Output:** [Writes finetuned checkpoint, auto-generated bundle configs under bundle/configs/, and structured output.json with Dice scores and runtime metadata] <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Checks whether skill-assisted execution avoids unsafe behavior such as secret leakage, destructive commands, or unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Checks whether the agent follows the expected workflow and produces the correct final output. <br>
- Discoverability: Checks whether the agent loads the skill when relevant and avoids using it when irrelevant. <br>
- Effectiveness: Checks whether the agent performs measurably better with the skill than without it. <br>
- Efficiency: Checks whether the agent uses fewer tokens and avoids redundant work. <br>
